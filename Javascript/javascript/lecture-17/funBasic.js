/*  JavaScript Function and Function Expressions */

/*

A function is a block of code that performs a specific task.

Suppose you need to create a program to create a circle and color it. You can create two functions to solve this problem:

a function to draw the circle

a function to color the circle

Dividing a complex problem into smaller chunks makes your program easy to understand and reusable.

JavaScript also has a huge number of inbuilt functions. For example, Math.sqrt() is a function to calculate the square root of a number.

    }
}

// A function is declared using the function keyword.
    // The basic rules of naming a function are similar to naming a variable. It is better to write a descriptive name for your function. For example, if a function is used to add two numbers, you could name the function add or addNumbers.
    // The body of function is written within {}.
